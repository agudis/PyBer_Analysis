# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis was to summarize ride-sharing data to help a company, PyBer, make future business decisions. The data was analyzed by three different city types: urban, suburban and rural. We started out by pulling different data series on each city type and then further drilled down into the total weekly fares for the city types. 

## Results 
Below will show numerous differences in ride-sharing data based on city types. 

### Total Rides, Drivers and Fares 
The first thing we looked was to find the total rides, drivers and fares that were in each city type by using the groupby function. If we are strictly just concerned about the total numbers in each city type, urban cities had the most rides, drivers and fares. This was followed by suburban, with rural having significantly lower numbers in each category. 

### Average Fare by Ride and Driver 
Since the totals do not allow us to really draw any conclusions yet, we looked at the average fare for each ride and the average fare for each driver in each city type. This data actually shows that the rural communities had the highest average fare for both rides and drivers. This was followed by suburban, with urban having the lowest fares for rides and drivers. 

### Summary Data 
The graph below summarizes the ride-sharing data that we spoke to above. You can clearly see in this graph that the totals are highest in the more populated areas, while the less populated city types have higher average fares for rides and drivers.

### Total Rides
Lastly, we analyzed the total fares by both city types and date. We were asked to specifically look at the months of January through April.

In this graph you can again see that urban city types had the highest total fares through all months followed by suburban and then rural. No matter what the city type is, they all increase in fares mid February and peak near the third week of February. For the rural and urban city types, they experience another peak in the beginning of April. Otherwise, each city type seems to have highs and lows throughout each month. 

## Summary
After analyzing the data below there are a few recommendations that could be made to address disparities among the city types. 

### Recommendation One 
It is evident that it is more expensive to ride in the rural areas. However, we are missing key data in which to determine the miles of each ride. Are the rural communities taking longer trips and therefore we do not have enough drivers for the demand? Gathering mileage data on each trip, for each city type, could help us to determine were we need to put our resources. 

### Recommendation Two
While urban communities have the highest totals in fares, drivers and rides, they also experience the lowest fare per driver. You can see that there are more drivers than there are total rides. This is affecting the average amount a driver can take home. Can PyBer decrease drivers in the area and still keep up with the demand? 

### Recommendation Three 
Lastly, it is suggested that PyBer look at their marketing strategies. On the occasions where we see dips in rides, are there specials we can run? Can we do more advertising in rural communities once we determine that we have enough drivers? Due to the number of drivers we have in the urban communities, are we able to find more riders? Advertising can greatly help to increase our visibility and profits.
